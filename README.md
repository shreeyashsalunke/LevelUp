In our hectic routine we perform simple tasks like filling up a glass of water and serving tea or coffee which although sounds very simple becomes very difficult when the visual feedback is removed from the scenario. Visually impaired people have a great difficulty in filling up liquids on a vessel and are not very confident to do it themselves with a fear of spilling things over.

The current method used by visually impaired people for filling up a vessel is by dipping their finger inside the vessel and finding out whether the liquid is wetting their finger. They find this technique unhygienic and not socially accepting; also they cannot apply this method to hot liquids like tea or coffee. This is very discouraging for them in a social gathering it makes them dependent on someoneâ€™s help for a simple task of filling up a glass of water.

Electronic liquid level Indicators are available but not economically viable. 80% of visually impaired patients are not privileged enough to buy these devices. The solution had to be frugal and innovative.

The device is 3D printed and works mechanically. It works on the principle of 'buoyancy'. The device has a small clip-on mechanism to fit on different tumblers, glasses and mugs. The vertical shaft is attached to the buoyant ball. The ball floats as the liquid level rises up to the brim, and the shaft rises up too. The visually impaired get a tactile feedback to stop the flow of liquid.

The device can be easily mass mantufactured using a 'food safe' material and can be used in Rehabilitation centers to train the visually impaired to become independent in performing their daily activities.
